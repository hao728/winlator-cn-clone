# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are appended to flags specified
# in C:\tools\adt-bundle-windows-x86_64-20131030\sdk/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt
# You can edit the include path and order by changing the proguardFiles
# directive in build.gradle.
#
# For more details, see
#   http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html

# Add any project specific keep options here:

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

-dontobfuscate

# Keep native methods: they are registered by name in JNI_OnLoad, so R8 must not
# remove them (a shrunk method makes RegisterNatives fail and the app cannot start).
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
    native <methods>;
